## TODO

- Switch to tokio single threaded (features = rt-core instead of rt-threaded)
	- Will enable us to use Rc instead of Arc and druid::im-rc instead of druid::im
- Loop reconnect on disconnect with reconnecting modal
    - On first occurence, don't prompt user, do it automatically for automatic connecting on first launch
    - kill ux
	- Add restart LCU button to reconnect modal
